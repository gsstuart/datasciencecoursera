## Synopsis

Presented here is an analysis of the NOAA storm database, which tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States.  This investigation seeks to determine which storm events have had the greatest impact on human health and property, by examining the NOAA storm database figures on fatalities, injuries, property damage costs, and crop damage costs.  Although the database stretches back to 1950, we will restrict this analysis to 1996 and later, based on <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/details.jsp" target="_blank">NOAA's reporting</a>,  that prior to 1996, event recording was non-standardized and irregular. 

We found that tornadoes and extreme heat have created the highest number fatalities and injuries; floods, hurricanes, and droughts are the worst offenders for crop and property damage.  The plots in this analysis list the top 10 storm events for each of these four consequences, in descending order of severity.

<br/>
## Data Processing

The original NOAA/NWS input file is read into data frame `storm`, which will serve as the primary source for the analysis.  To minimize the footprint of this large dataset, columns not used in the analysis are dropped.  Investigators reproducing this analysis should have this script and the `repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2` input file in the current working directory.

After each stage of processing a sample of the data will be presented.

```{r loadData, cache=TRUE}
colClasses = c("numeric","character","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","character","character","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","character","numeric","numeric","numeric","numeric","character","numeric","character","character","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL")
storm <- read.csv('repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2', colClasses=colClasses)
glimpse(storm)
```


Column `pdate` is added to provide the event date in a POSIX-compliant format, and the range of dates covered in the input file is calculated for inclusion in plots.  At this point `storm` is also filtered to drop rows of data prior to 1996.

```{r}
storm$pdate <- as.Date(storm$BGN_DATE, "%m/%d/%Y")
storm <- filter(storm, as.numeric(format(storm$pdate, "%Y")) >= 1996)
pdate_range <- format(range(storm$pdate), '%b %Y')
pdate_range_str <- paste0(pdate_range[[1]], " - ", pdate_range[[2]])
sample_n(select(storm, EVTYPE, BGN_DATE, pdate), 10)
```

Columns `prop_dmg_tot` and `crop_dmg_tot` are added to provide the numeric dollar amount of property and crop damage, respectively.  The input file represents this as a base number and a multiplier.  As per section 2.7 of the NWS codebook, this multiplier can take a value of "K" for thousands, "M" for millions, and "B" for billions.  In this transformation the corresponding multiplication is performed, matching case-insensitively on these multiplier values and ignoring any others.  Multipliers outside the documented range do exist sparsely in the data.

```{r}
storm$prop_dmg_tot <- storm$PROPDMG * ifelse(storm$PROPDMGEXP %in% c('k','K'), 1e+03,
                                      ifelse(storm$PROPDMGEXP %in% c('m','M'), 1e+06,
                                      ifelse(storm$PROPDMGEXP %in% c('b','B'), 1e+09, 0)))

storm$crop_dmg_tot <- storm$CROPDMG * ifelse(storm$CROPDMGEXP %in% c('k','K'), 1e+03,
                                      ifelse(storm$CROPDMGEXP %in% c('m','M'), 1e+06,
                                      ifelse(storm$CROPDMGEXP %in% c('b','B'), 1e+09, 0)))
sample_n(select(filter(storm, prop_dmg_tot > 0, crop_dmg_tot > 0), EVTYPE, PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, prop_dmg_tot, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP, crop_dmg_tot), 10)
```

The `EVTYPE` column in the original data specifies the type of storm, based on the storm designations in the NWS codebook.  This data field is highly unstructured, with many different labels used to described the same phenomenon; this is due to differing naming conventions, abbreviations, and misspellings introduced by the wide variety of researchers contributing to this data set.

An example of the ambiguity of `EVTYPE`:

```{r}
unique(storm[grepl("LIGHT SNOW", storm$EVTYPE, ignore.case = TRUE), 'EVTYPE'])
```

As this analysis will perform aggregations based on event type, `EVTYPE` will be standardized to eliminate much of this ambiguity.  Since this analysis is only concerned with storm events that have caused injury to people or property, this standardization will be limited to only those events.

```{r}
unique(storm[storm$FATALITIES + storm$INJURIES + storm$PROPDMG + storm$CROPDMG > 0, 'EVTYPE'])
```
*Table x.*  The list of unique storm event types that have caused injury, death, property damage, or crop damage.

A new list `storm_evmap` is created, which will create a higher-level designation into which each storm event listed above will be classed.  For example, both "LIGHT SNOW" and "Light Snowfall" will be mapped to a new category "SNOW".  The mappings are based on a review of the NWS codebook, as well as common-sense examination of the various `EVTYPE` values.  Investigators wishing to explore alternate classifications can easily modify this mapping and re-execute to see the results based on new mappings.  The author also suggests that investigators expanding on this work move this mapping to a seperate CSV file.  To ensure compliance with the specifications for this analysis, however, the mapping will be performed completely in-line; the author regrets any inconvenience over the lack of brevity in the surrounding sections of code.

# show a sample
storm_evmap[9:11]
```

To efficiently merge this list with the `storm` data frame, it is converted to a data frame:

```{r}
storm_evmap <- ldply(storm_evmap, function(EVTYPE) data.frame(EVTYPE))
head(storm_evmap)
```

Primary data set `storm` is now joined with `storm_evmap`, and the new category variable renamed to `EV_LEVEL1`:

```{r}
storm <- join(storm, storm_evmap, by = "EVTYPE")
storm <- rename(storm, c(".id" = "EV_LEVEL1"))
sample_n(select(storm, EVTYPE, EV_LEVEL1), 10)
```
